# Cretti Performance Optimization Guide

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Bundle Optimization
- **Advanced Code Splitting**: Components are split into separate chunks
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed
- **Minification**: JavaScript and CSS are minified in production
- **Chunk Size Limits**: Warnings for bundles exceeding 300KB

### 2. Image Optimization
- **Advanced Image Component**: WebP support with fallbacks
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when in viewport
- **Responsive Images**: Different sizes for different screen sizes
- **Preloading**: Critical images are preloaded

### 3. Caching Strategy
- **Service Worker**: Implements cache-first and network-first strategies
- **Static Asset Caching**: Long-term caching for unchanging assets
- **Dynamic Content**: Stale-while-revalidate for HTML pages
- **Offline Support**: Basic offline functionality

### 4. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- **Route-based Splitting**: Each page is a separate chunk
- **Component Lazy Loading**: Non-critical components load on demand
- **Intelligent Preloading**: Routes preload based on user behavior
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Proper loading states for all lazy components

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS tracking
- **Memory Monitoring**: JavaScript heap usage tracking
- **Component Performance**: Render time monitoring
- **Bundle Analysis**: Automated bundle size analysis

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Target Metrics
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1
- **JavaScript Bundle**: < 250KB
- **CSS Bundle**: < 50KB
- **Total Bundle**: < 500KB

## 📈 Performance Best Practices

### 1. Component Optimization
- Use `memo()` for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Avoid inline functions in render
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` appropriately

### 2. Asset Optimization
- Compress images before adding to project
- Use WebP format when possible
- Implement responsive image loading
- Preload critical resources

### 3. Code Organization
- Keep components small and focused
- Use lazy loading for non-critical features
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize bundle splitting

### 4. Network Optimization
- Enable gzip/brotli compression
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement proper caching headers
- Minimize HTTP requests

## 🚨 Performance Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Bundle size warnings during build
- Performance metrics in development
- Memory usage monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking

### Manual Testing
- Lighthouse audits
- WebPageTest analysis
- Network throttling tests
- Device performance testing

## 🔄 Continuous Optimization

### Regular Tasks
1. Run bundle analysis monthly
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals
3. Update dependencies regularly
4. Review and optimize images
5. Test on various devices

### Performance Budget
- Monitor bundle size growth
- Set performance budgets in CI/CD
- Regular performance audits
- User experience monitoring
